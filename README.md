# How to Solve It By Computer - Algorithm Collection

This repository is a collection of programs mirroring the algorithm implementations as outlined in R.G. Dromey's 1982 publication How to Solve It By Computer. 

Originally the programs outlined are written in Pascal, but given that Pascal is for the most part English-like and easy to read, it is a welcome challenge to translate the algorithms into Python. 

Included is also some numerical methods such as Euler's Method. 

## 02
This chapter covers fundamental algorithms such as implementing a function calculating sine from its corresponding infinite series, or summing a set of numbers and averaging.
